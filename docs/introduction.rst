Introduction
============

Django-Mingus is a blog engine leveraging only existing reusable apps and Django snippets. The project defines no models.

The project was conceptualized for a Django-NYC lightning talk with the goal of introducing Django developers to the concepts behind integrating existing reusable apps in their project as well as leveraging virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper, and pip into their workflow.
